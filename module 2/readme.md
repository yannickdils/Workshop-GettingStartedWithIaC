## Enabling static website hosting in Azure Storage

You can serve static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files) directly from a storage container named ```$web```. Hosting your content in Azure Storage enables you to use serverless architectures that include Azure Functions and other Platform as a service (PaaS) services. Azure Storage static website hosting is a great option in cases where you don't require a web server to render content.

1. Open the newly created storage account.
2. In the left blade, scroll to the **Data management**.
3. Select the **Static website** option.

To enable static website hosting, select the name of your default file, and then optionally provide a path to a custom 404 page.

4. To enable the static website hosting, select the "**Enabled**" option.
5. Set the index document name to "**index.html**"
6. Error document path to "**error.html**"
7. Hit the "**save**" button
