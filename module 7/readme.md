# Module 7: Github ðŸ’– BICEP

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions optimize code delivery time from idea to deployment on a community-powered platform. We will use a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) system to automate all the build, test, and deployment tasks. We can combine our knowledge of infrastructure as code (IaC) to automate the deployment of the infrastructure.

There are several tools available to help you achieve these goals. However, since you're already using GitHub for your code repository, you decide to investigate GitHub Actions to see if it provides the automation you need.

## Generate deployment credentials

Your GitHub action runs under an identity. Use the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?view=azure-cli-latest) command to create a [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux) for the identity.

Replace the placeholder `myApp` with the name of your application. Replace `{subscription-id}` with your subscription ID.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myApp --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/"hogent-(initials)-rg" --sdk-auth
```

> ðŸ’¡ The scope in the previous example is limited to the resource group. We recommend that you grant minimum required access.

The output is a JSON object with the role assignment credentials that provide access to your App Service app similar to below. Copy this JSON object for later. You'll only need the sections with the `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `subscriptionId`, and `tenantId` values.

```output
  {
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
  }
```

## Configure the GitHub secrets

Create secrets for your Azure credentials, resource group, and subscriptions.

1. In [GitHub](https://github.com/), navigate to your repository.

1. Select **Settings > Secrets > New secret**.

1. Paste the entire JSON output from the Azure CLI command into the secret's value field. Name the secret `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.

1. Create another secret named `AZURE_RG`. Add the name of your resource group to the secret's value field (`"hogent-(initials)-rg"`).

1. Create another secret named `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION`. Add your subscription ID to the secret's value field (example: `90fd3f9d-4c61-432d-99ba-1273f236afa2`).

## Add a Bicep file

Add a Bicep file to your GitHub repository. In the module 7 directory, a template bicep file is available.

You can put the file anywhere in the repository. The workflow sample in the next section assumes the Bicep file is named **main.bicep**, and is stored in the 'module 7' folder of your repository.

## Create workflow

A workflow defines the steps to execute when triggered. It's a YAML (.yml) file in the **.github/workflows/** path of your repository. The workflow file extension can be either **.yml** or **.yaml**.

To create a workflow, take the following steps:

1. From your GitHub repository, select **Actions** from the top menu.
1. Select **New workflow**.
1. Select **set up a workflow yourself**.
1. Rename the workflow file if you prefer a different name other than **main.yml**. For example: **deployBicepFile.yml**.
1. Replace the content of the yml file with the following code:

    ```yml
    on: [push]
    name: Azure ARM
    jobs:
      build-and-deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:

          # Checkout code
        - uses: actions/checkout@main

          # Log into Azure
        - uses: azure/login@v1
          with:
            creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

          # Deploy Bicep file
        - name: deploy
          uses: azure/arm-deploy@v1
          with:
            subscriptionId: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
            resourceGroupName: ${{ secrets.AZURE_RG }}
            template: '"./module 7/main.bicep"'
            failOnStdErr: false
    ```

    Replace `mystore` with your own storage account name prefix.

    > ðŸ’¡ You can specify a JSON format parameters file instead in the ARM Deploy action (example: `.azuredeploy.parameters.json`).

    The first section of the workflow file includes:

    - **name**: The name of the workflow.
    - **on**: The name of the GitHub events that triggers the workflow. The workflow is triggered when there's a push event on the main branch.

1. Select **Start commit**.
1. Select **Commit directly to the main branch**.
1. Select **Commit new file** (or **Commit changes**).

Updating either the workflow file or Bicep file triggers the workflow. The workflow starts right after you commit the changes.

## Check workflow status

1. Select the **Actions** tab. You'll see a **Create deployStorageAccount.yml** workflow listed. It takes 1-2 minutes to run the workflow.
1. Select the workflow to open it.
1. Select **Run ARM deploy** from the menu to verify the deployment.

## Enabling Static Site Hosting

Try expanding the Workflow's steps so that you can [enable static site hosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to?tabs=azure-portal) on the Storage Account via the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell. Additionally you should proceed to copy over the static website files, from [module 2](https://github.com/yannickdils/Workshop-GettingStartedWithIaC/tree/main/module%202/simple-static-site), to the Azure Storage Account's ```$web``` container.

> ðŸ’¡ Optionally you could look in to the [azcopy tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10), which is the preferred way to transfer all sorts of files to Azure Storage.

## Clean up resources

When your resource group and repository are no longer needed, clean up the resources you deployed by deleting the resource group and your GitHub repository.

Via the Azure CLI:

```shell
az group delete --name "hogent-(initials)-rg"
```

Via Azure PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "hogent-(initials)-rg""
```
